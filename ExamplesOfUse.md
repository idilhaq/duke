# Introduction #

This page lists some real-world examples of using Duke, and links to pages explaining the use cases in more detail.

# Linking countries #

The LinkingCountries example links countries from [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org) with countries from [the Mondial database](http://www.dbis.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/Mondial/).

# Deduplicating conference presenters #

The SemanticDogfood example contains data about [conference presenters at semantic web conferences](http://data.semanticweb.org/). This data is carefully produced from the conference proceedings of each conference, but still contains duplicate authors.

# Linking bibliographic data #

The DeichmanLink example connects data about authors from the
library catalog of [the Deichman Library](http://www.deichmanske-bibliotek.oslo.kommune.no/) in Norway with person
data from [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org).
