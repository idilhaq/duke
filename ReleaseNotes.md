# Duke 1.2 (coming soon) #

The main change in this version is the new, and much faster, blocking backends. Note that this version introduces API changes and changes to the [XMLConfig](XMLConfig.md) that are not backwards compatible. Read on for details.

Other new features:

  * Added longest common substring comparator.
  * LuceneDatabase now uses fuzzy search by default (which is much slower).
  * New default Record implementation, faster and uses less memory.
  * Support for changing CSV value separator.
  * Databases are now pluggable (see DatabaseConfig).
  * Improved inference of links in LinkDatabase.

API changes:

  * The ModifiableRecord interface was added.
  * Two methods have been added to the Database interface.
  * The DatabaseProperties class has been removed.
  * All Database implementations have moved into the duke.databases package.
  * The Configuration.createDatabase method is replaced by Configuration.getDatabase.
  * The Link and LinkFileWriter interfaces have changed, and now require a confidence value.
  * The TestFileUtils class is deprecated, and will be removed in the next release.

**NOTE:** The change to the XMLConfig concerns how databases are configured. The `<param>` elements inside the root element now have no effect, and the `<path>` element is no longer supported. Instead, the `<database>` element has been introduced. See XMLConfig and DatabaseConfig for details.

**NOTE:** The link database schema has changed: the confidence column has been included. If you have an existing link database you need to add this column.

**NOTE**:  The link file syntax has changed to be a proper CSV file and include the confidence.
