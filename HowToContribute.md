# Introduction #

There are many ways you can contribute. Perhaps the easiest is to join the discussion on [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/duke-dedup). Another is to report bugs and feature requests in the issue tracker, or even to comment on the ones already there. Work on open issues is always welcome.

# Contributing code #

If you want to contribute code, the easiest way to do it is to create a clone of the repository. You can then commit your changes to the source code and push them into the clone. The changes will be open for anyone to see, and the developers can pull your changes into the main repository. This is much easier than passing patches around by email.

# Coding style #

It's helpful if patches adhere to the CodingStyle. If not, I will accept them anyway, but rework them until they do.
