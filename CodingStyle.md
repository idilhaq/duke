# Naming #

In general, we try to make the code read as much like English as possible. We therefore do not decorate class and variable names with Hungarian notation or anything like it.

Interfaces are named after the concept they represent, with no markers to indicate that they are interfaces.

# Indentation #

Indentation is two spaces, with curly braces positioned as is usual in Java.

No tabs may occur in source code.
